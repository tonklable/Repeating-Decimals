# Repeating-Decimals
This project aims to calculate repeating decimals of a division by natural number denominator. I tried not to use list functions including append and index. Instead, I used string adding and split function. Firstly, in the for loop, I add remainders to string with "\'" as a splitter, and I detect if the remainder is in the remainder string(by using split to change it to list.) If there is, I check which index of string is the repeating remainder so that I will use the index later, and the for loop ends. If there isn't, I add the remainder in to the string (indeed, add "\'" as well. Moreover, in the for loop I add the quotient to the string of number. Lastly, I print the number out with the repeating decimals in the brackets; repeating decimals need the index of where repeating started. Consequently, the result exist. If the repeating decimals are 0, there will be nothing in the bracket. To improve this project, I suggest to use list functions such as append and index.
